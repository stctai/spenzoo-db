# CS5200 Project 1

### Application name: Spenzoo

### Team member: YuHan Chi, Tzu-Chi Tai

### Project proposal: Implenting a database for an expense tracking app including the following features:

- CRUD user expenses with customizable details, i.e. date, amount, category, desciption, etc..
- Users can create multiple accounts to better record the payment method used for each transaction. For example, an account named BofA will include all the expenses paid with a Bank of America Credit Card.
- User can set periodical budgets for themselves, with a desired starting date and the duration of the budget cycle.
- The percentage of each expense is set to 100% by default. However, if the user is sharing the bill with other users, manually type in the percentage he/she is paying to split the bill among friends.
- User can view their expenses grouped over categories, period of time, or account.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. Provide user info to create user
5. Linked user ID to budget ID
6. Click button to delete data

For the project, we discussed and wrote down the business requirements together, then split the tasks as below:

Hannah Chi @YuHan Chi worked on:
UML Class Diagram
Creating the database with SQLite and writing the queries that represent the key features of our app

Tzu-Chi Tai @Sabrina Tai worked on:
ERD and relational schema
Generating test data with the help of Mockaroo

Then for the point 8, creating a basic Node + Express application, we implemented together by doing pair programming. All commits are made by Sabrina because we organized everything to do a checkdown before submitting the final work.
